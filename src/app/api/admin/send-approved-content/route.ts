Alaska's craft beer scene represents one of America's most challenging and rewarding brewing environments. Where winter temperatures can reach -40¬∞F and summer brings midnight sun, brewers have created a unique culture that combines historical authenticity, extreme innovation, and community resilience. Our seven-day journey through the Last Frontier reveals breweries that don't just survive Alaska's conditions - they thrive in them.

## Week 2 Schedule: Seven Days of Arctic Brewing Excellence

### Day 1: Alaskan Brewing Company - Juneau
**Featured Beer: Alaskan Amber (5.3% ABV, 18 IBU)**

Our Alaska journey begins with the state's pioneering brewery, founded in 1986 by Marcy and Geoff Larson. What makes this brewery extraordinary is their flagship beer's authenticity - the recipe was discovered in the Juneau-Douglas City Museum, where historical records showed Douglas City Brewing Company operated from 1899-1907 using this exact formulation.

*Tasting Notes: Deep amber with copper highlights, crystal clear with creamy off-white head. Rich caramel malt sweetness with floral Saaz hop character and subtle bread notes.*

### Day 2: Midnight Sun Brewing - Anchorage
**Featured Beer: Sockeye Red IPA (5.7% ABV, 70 IBU)**

Founded in 1995, Midnight Sun represents Alaska's bold brewing attitude with aggressive hop-forward beers and experimental barrel-aging programs. Their Sockeye Red IPA has been Anchorage's flagship craft beer, showcasing Pacific Northwest hop culture adapted to Alaska's extreme conditions.

*Tasting Notes: Deep amber-red with copper highlights, hazy with persistent off-white head. Explosive citrus and pine with grapefruit, orange peel, and resinous hop character.*

### Day 3: King Street Brewing - Anchorage
**Featured Beer: Chocolate Coconut Porter (6.0% ABV, 35 IBU)**

King Street Brewing specializes in creative flavor combinations that bring warmth to Alaska's long winters. Their Chocolate Coconut Porter exemplifies their philosophy of creating tropical escapes through beer, using hand-toasted coconut and premium cacao nibs to transport drinkers to warmer climates.

*Tasting Notes: Deep black with ruby highlights, tan head with excellent retention. Rich chocolate, toasted coconut, vanilla, coffee with smooth chocolate and coconut sweetness.*

### Day 4: Cynosure Brewing - Anchorage
**Featured Beer: Belgian Triple (9.7% ABV, 25 IBU)**

Cynosure Brewing Company specializes in traditional European beer styles, bringing Old World brewing techniques to Alaska's frontier environment. The brewery name "Cynosure" means "center of attention" - representing their commitment to excellence in classical beer styles rarely found in Alaska.

*Tasting Notes: Pale gold with crystal clarity, white foam head with good retention. Spicy phenolics, fruity esters, honey, coriander with smooth honey sweetness and warming alcohol.*

### Day 5: Resolution Brewing - Anchorage
**Featured Beer: New England IPA (6.2% ABV, 45 IBU)**

Taking its name from Captain James Cook's ship HMS Resolution, which explored Alaska's waters in the 1770s, this brewery represents modern craft brewing's exploration spirit. Their focus on contemporary hop-forward styles like New England IPAs makes them popular with Anchorage's younger craft beer enthusiasts.

*Tasting Notes: Hazy orange-gold with minimal head retention. Tropical fruit explosion with mango, pineapple, citrus. Creamy mouthfeel, low bitterness, tropical juice character.*

### Day 6: HooDoo Brewing - Fairbanks
**Featured Beer: German K√∂lsch (4.8% ABV, 22 IBU)**

Founded in 2012 in Fairbanks, HooDoo Brewing brings authentic German brewing techniques to Alaska's interior, where winter temperatures can reach -40¬∞F. Their German K√∂lsch showcases traditional European brewing in extreme conditions, requiring precise temperature control that's challenging in Alaska's climate.

curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/setup-comprehensive-database \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "full_setup", "force": false}'
```

### Partial Setup (if needed)
```bash
# Set up only core tables
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/setup-comprehensive-database \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "core_tables"}'

# Set up only indexes
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/setup-comprehensive-database \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "indexes"}'
```

### Manual SQL Execution
If API setup fails, execute the comprehensive SQL file directly:
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor or psql
\i database-comprehensive-setup.sql
```

## 🔍 Verification Queries

### Table Count Verification
```sql
SELECT 
  'blog_posts' as table_name, count(*) as record_count FROM blog_posts
UNION ALL
SELECT 'beer_reviews', count(*) FROM beer_reviews
UNION ALL
SELECT 'state_progress', count(*) FROM state_progress
UNION ALL
SELECT 'social_posts', count(*) FROM social_posts
UNION ALL

```

### Real-time Testing
```javascript
// Test realtime subscriptions in browser console
const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY);

const subscription = supabase
  .channel('state_progress_changes')
  .on('postgres_changes', 
    { event: '*', schema: 'public', table: 'state_progress' },
    (payload) => console.log('Change received!', payload)
  )
  .subscribe();

üç∫ Day 3 of Alabama Week! 

Birmingham's @trimpinbrewing absolutely nailed this Hazy IPA. The Mosaic and Citra hops create this incredible tropical fruit explosion that somehow doesn't overpower the smooth, creamy mouthfeel.

What makes this special? They use a unique dry-hopping technique where they add hops during active fermentation - it's called "biotransformation" and it creates flavors you literally can't get any other way.

The brewery started in a garage just 5 years ago, and now they're distributing across three states. Sometimes the best stories are the ones still being written.

Have you tried any Birmingham breweries? Drop your recommendations below! üëá

Just tried @trimpinbrewing's Hazy IPA in Birmingham. The biotransformation dry-hopping technique creates flavors you literally can't replicate any other way. Garage to 3-state distribution in 5 years - that's the craft beer dream right there. üç∫‚ú® #AlabamaBeer #CraftBeer
```

#### TikTok Script Style:
```
[Scene: Hop holding beer in front of brewery]
"This looks like any other hazy IPA, right? Wrong. This brewery uses something called biotransformation - they add hops DURING fermentation, not after. Watch what happens when I taste it..."
[Takes sip, reacts]
"THAT is what innovation tastes like. Started in a garage, now they're crushing it across three states. Sometimes the best beers come from the biggest dreamers."

# Alabama: Where Southern Hospitality Meets Craft Innovation

When I tell people I'm exploring Alabama's craft beer scene, I usually get one of two reactions: surprise that Alabama HAS a craft beer scene, or excitement from someone who already knows the secret. After spending a week here, I'm firmly in the excited camp.

Alabama's brewing story isn't just about great beer (though there's plenty of that). It's about communities coming together, old traditions meeting new innovations, and the kind of Southern hospitality that makes every brewery feel like someone's welcoming you into their home.

Take Birmingham's Trim Pin Brewing, where I started my Alabama journey...

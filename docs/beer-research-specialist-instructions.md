# Beer Research Specialist Instructions
## Comprehensive Guidelines for State Beer Content Creation

### üéØ Primary Objective
Research and identify **7 unique breweries** from each U.S. state, each with one representative flagship/notable beer, to create authentic state-by-state craft beer content for BrewQuest Chronicles.

### üîç Critical Requirements

#### Brewery Selection Rules
1. **EXACTLY 7 UNIQUE BREWERIES per state** - No duplicates allowed
2. **One beer per brewery** - Each brewery contributes only one featured beer
3. **Geographic diversity** - Include breweries from different cities/regions within the state
4. **Mix of sizes** - Combine established names with notable local favorites
5. **Style variety** - Ensure diverse beer styles (IPA, stout, porter, lager, etc.)

#### Research Focus Areas

##### 1. State Brewing History & Context
- **Founding dates** of key breweries (especially first/pioneering breweries)
- **Legal landscape** (any unique brewing laws, historical restrictions)
- **Economic impact** (number of breweries, economic contribution, employment)
- **Per capita brewery rankings** nationally
- **Unique challenges** specific to that state (climate, regulations, supply chain)

##### 2. Brewery Deep Dive (for each of 7 selected breweries)
- **Full brewery name and location** (city, state)
- **Founding year and founders** (when available)
- **Flagship beer details**: Name, ABV, IBU, style, detailed description
- **Awards and recognition** for the featured beer
- **Unique brewing techniques** or special ingredients
- **Distribution footprint** (local, regional, national)
- **Brewery philosophy/story** that makes them distinctive

##### 3. Local Ingredients & Unique Characteristics

- **Traditional techniques** unique to the region
- **Climate impacts** on brewing (how geography affects beer production)
- **Local food pairings** and cultural connections
- **Tourism integration** (brewery trails, destinations)

##### 4. Beer Specifications (for each featured beer)
- **Exact ABV percentage**
- **IBU level** (when available)
- **Beer style classification** (use BJCP or BA style guidelines)
- **Detailed tasting notes**: appearance, aroma, taste, mouthfeel

#### Content Restrictions

- **No discontinued beers** - Focus on currently available offerings
- **No contract brewing** - Prefer breweries that actually brew on-site
- **No chain operations** - Focus on independent, local operations

### üéØ Quality Standards

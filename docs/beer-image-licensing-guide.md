# Beer Image Licensing & Legal Guidelines

## Overview

This guide ensures ethical and legal use of brewery and beer images for the BrewQuest Chronicles blog. Craft breweries are supportive of authentic editorial coverage, but proper protocols must be followed.

## Legal Framework

### Fair Use Considerations

**Editorial Use Qualifies for Fair Use When:**
- ‚úÖ Non-commercial educational/editorial content
- ‚úÖ Commentary, criticism, or review purposes
- ‚úÖ Limited use (single product image per beer)
- ‚úÖ Proper attribution and source crediting
- ‚úÖ No impact on brewery's commercial market
- ‚úÖ Transformative use (part of larger editorial work)

**Fair Use Does NOT Apply When:**
- ‚ùå Commercial advertising or promotion
- ‚ùå Selling merchandise with brewery images
- ‚ùå Using images without attribution
- ‚ùå Reproducing entire brewery catalogs
- ‚ùå Creating derivative works for profit

### Copyright Ownership

**Image Rights Hierarchy:**
1. **Brewery Owns:** Official product photography, marketing materials
2. **Photographer Owns:** Professional brewery photoshoots (may be licensed to brewery)
3. **User Generated:** Individual photos (personal copyright, platform terms apply)
4. **Stock Photos:** Licensed imagery (check usage rights)

## Best Practices by Source Type

### 1. Official Brewery Images (Preferred)
